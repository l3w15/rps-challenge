# RPS Challenge

## To run the app:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:l3w15x/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
```

From there it's pretty self explanatory!

This was an interesting challenge and mostly building the app was OK, just ran into a couple of issues such as forgetting to put the " visit '/' " line in feature tests.

Tests are my only other concern with this app. I have 100% coverage through feature tests only, and using feature tests was very useful in building the app. Whilst I do feel my approach has been test driven, I'd still like to feel that everything was test-driven and to have some robust unit testing.
